Point Light
Illuminate the environment in all direction, but the intensity of their light withers as it gets further away
- the intensity of the light have inverse square law 1/d^2 (bukan ini), tapi 1/(ad^2+bd+1)
- ax^2 -> quadratic term 
- bx -> linear term 
apply to speculat and diffuse


Directional Light
Consider so distantt from your scene, that the light rays it emits are essentially parallel to one another, just like the rays of the Sun
