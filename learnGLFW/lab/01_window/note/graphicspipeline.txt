Graphics pipe line is a series of function that take some data at the beginning and the end it out a frame

Input : vertexdata[] -> array of vertices, contain (position, color or texture coordinate)

1. Vertex Shader
Take the positions of the vertices and transforms them or keep them on the same positions

2. Shape Assembly
Takes all positions and connects them according to a primitive.
primitive -> a shape such as triange, point or a line.
Each primitive interprets the data differently. 
- Triangle will take 3 points and draw a triangle between them
- Lines will take 2 points and draw a line between them

3. Geometry Shader
Can add vertices and then create new primitive out of already existing primitives

4. Rasterization
transforms mathemathical shape into an actual pixel

5. Fragment Shader
add colors to the pixel
depend on lighting, texture or shadows

6. Test and Blending 
process overlapping object.
blending the transparent object to the final color
