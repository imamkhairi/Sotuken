Color of an object actually the result of multiplying the RBG of the light and the object

the higher the angle between a surface and the source of light -> the less intense color is on that surface
-> so we need to know the position of the light and the slope of the object (using a normal vector)

# NORMALS
Normals are unit vectors, that help up calculate how light should act on a certain object

- These can be either perpendicular to the surface of one trianle (called face normal)
Will produce flat shading

- Arrange on different way such as being perpendicular to the plane created by all the adjacent vertices (called vertex normal)
Will produce smooth shading
