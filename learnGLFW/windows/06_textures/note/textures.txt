texture can be 1D, 2D, 3D

Texture unit 
-> kind of slots for textures, that come as bundle 
generally holds about 16 textures, and allow fragment shader work with all at the same time.



# How image will be processed when scale up or down

- GL_NEAREST
-> Keeps all the pixels as they are (preferred for pixel arts) 

- GL_LINEAR
-> create new pixels according to the pixels nearby (relusts in a blurred image)


# How texture will be repeated

- GL_REPEAT
-> repeat the image 

- GL_MIRRORED_REPEAT
-> repeat but mirror it every repeats

- GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE
-> stetch the border of the image

- GL_CLAMP_TO_BORDER
-> put flat color of your choice outside of the image

This can be mixed, since its only apply for one axis.
This axis is named (s, t, r) corresponding to (x, y, z)


# Mipmap

Smaller resolution versions, of the same texture that are used when the texture is far away for example


# Coordinate for Texture

Start from 0,0 on the bottom left
0,1   1,1
 
0,0   0,1

If the value higher than 1, the texture will be repeated such as in this example.


# Image upside down

OpenGL reads images form the bottom left corner to the top right corner, 
while stb reads from the top left corner to the bottom right corner
