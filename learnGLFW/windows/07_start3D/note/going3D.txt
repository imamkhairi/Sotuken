OpenGL restrict the coordinate to normalize coordinate


# Local Coordinate (Object Space)
Local coordinate is the coordinate which its origin same with the object origin
Usually located at the center of an object
Simply the coordinate system that the model was made in

# World Coordinate
Whose origin is at the center of the world
These coordinate usually contatin the location of other object
Coordinate system where the model is going to be in

# View Coordinate 
Which have the smae origin as a camera or viewpoint
This don not yet account for perspective
Everything is relative to camera positions.
The camera never moves, the world moves around the camera

# Clip Coordinate
Essentially the same as the view coordinate, 
except they clip (delete) any vertices outside the normalize range, 
and can also account the perspective

# Screen Coordinate
Where everything is flattened out such that it can be viewed on your screen


Local ---Model Matrix---> world
world ---View Matrix---> view
view ---Projection Matrix---> clip
clip ---Automatic---> screen

+z axis is toward viewpoint 


Model Matrix -> transform the model from object space into the world space (one for each model)

View Matrix -> Transform from the world coordinate system to camera coordiante system (one only)

Projection Matrix -> Take 3D data and project it into 2D space
Two kind :
- Orthographic: depth doesn't matter
- Perspective: Used to give depth to the screen
The result of multiplying with projection matrix gives the normalize device coordinate (-1.0 ~ 1.0)
