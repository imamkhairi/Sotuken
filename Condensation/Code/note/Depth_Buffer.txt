Common problem that appear with depth buffer

Z-fighting
-> occurs because two or more triangle have the same depth buffer
thus the depth function can't decide which one is closer (keep changing between them constantly)

- Prevent :
Make sure you dont have triangle that too close to one another and parallel
if Z-fighting appears at a far away distance, tweak the function of depth buffer so that you have more precision
Use bigger buffer size
